Hello, I'm RandomGuyWithoutY, I would consider myself to be a shitposter and also a great code enthusiast. My all over ambition in making free software is to erase bloatware forever and make software as good again as it once was. Also I write code because it's fun to me.
I would like to support anyone who needs help with their projects so that software can be made better collectively, which would be very nice to see in my opinion.
Things I know stuff about include:
  - Website developement in CSS and HTML, as well as PHP
  - Basic Python and C++ knowledge
  - Intuitive understandig of tools and software in many cases
  - Common sense (probably my most useful abbility out of all of them alongside the tool knowledge)
If you would like to contact me for some questionable reason, take this mail adress of mine:
  randomguywithouty@protonmail.com
With that all being said, go on and do whatever you want. Also, join the Illuminati please.
