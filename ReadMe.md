Hello, I'm RandomGuyWithoutY, I would consider myself to be a shitposter and also a great code enthusiast. My all over ambition in making free software is to erase bloatware forever and make software as good again as it once was. Also I write code because it's fun to me.<br/>
I would like to support anyone who needs help with their projects so that software can be made better collectively, which would be very nice to see in my opinion.
Things I know stuff about include:<br/>
  - Website developement in CSS and HTML, as well as PHP
  - Basic Python and C++ knowledge
  - Intuitive understandig of tools and software in many cases
  - Common sense (probably my most useful abbility out of all of them alongside the tool knowledge)<br/>
If you would like to contact me for some questionable reason, take this mail adress of mine:<br/>
  randomguywithouty@protonmail.com<br/>
With that all being said, go on and do whatever you want. Also, join the Illuminati please.
