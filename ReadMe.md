# About Me #

Certified shitposter who is currently obsessed with coding and computers. I get zero women, so I signed up to GitHub instead. For reasons of marketability most war crime references on this profile had to be removed.

If you would like to contact me for some questionable reason, use the attached email address of mine.

I might be the reason why god left this place. JavaScript was a mistake.
