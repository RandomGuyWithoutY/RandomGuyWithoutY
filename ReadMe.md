Hello, I'm RandomGuyWithoutY, I would consider myself a shitposter as well as a code enthusiast. My general goal in programming free software is to erase bloatware out of existance and make software efficient again.
I would like to support anyone who needs help in programming so we all can collectively make software better, which would be very nice to see in my opinion.
Things I know stuff about include:
  - Website developement in CSS and HTML, as well as PHP
  - Python and C++ knowledge
  - Binary
  - Basic tool knowledge
  - Common sense
If you would like to contact me for some questionable reason, take this mail adress of mine:
  randomguywithouty@protonmail.com
With that said, hope you enjoy my profile or idk what. Join the Illuminati, please.
