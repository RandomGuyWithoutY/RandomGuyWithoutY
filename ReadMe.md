# About Me

Hello, I'm RandomGuyWithoutY, I would consider myself to be a shitposter and also a great code enthusiast. My all over ambition in making free software is to erase bloatware forever and make software as good again as it once was. Also I write code because it's fun to me.

I would like to support anyone who needs help with their projects so that software can be made better collectively, which would be very nice to see in my opinion.
Things I know stuff about include:<br/>
  - Website developement in CSS and HTML
  - Basic C and C++ knowledge (by that I mean that I have heard of it's existance)
  - General development in Python
  - Common sense (probably my most useful abbility)

If you would like to contact me for some questionable reason, take this mail address of mine:

  - RandomGuyWithoutY@protonmail.com

In addition to that I would like to mention that I am the founder of the BinaryIsBloat-community as well as it's child organisation Illuminatisoft Inc.

With that all being said, go on and do whatever you want. Also, join the Illuminati please.
